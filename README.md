- 👋 Hi, I’m @IS-JJ
- 👀 I’m interested in everything except working,basketball is my favourate relaxing method.And Kobe is the best basketball player in the world!!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Python.It's not my main job and I just want to improve myself and get into this quickly changing world //
     in this quite funny way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something interesting,such as making a game or achieving a new project. 
- 📫 How to reach me ? Maybe just message me(I'm new here,I'm not sure the method that have been provided by GitHub.)
- !!! Why do I write these funny message? I think the reason is that I don't want to do my own job and I'm quite lazy.(I do think I will change it when I start to code.)
